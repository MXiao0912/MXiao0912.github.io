Note: THE GOOGLE SOMETHING HTML IS THE GOOGLE VERIFYING FILE, MAKE SURE TO ALWAYS COPY AND PASTE IT BACK TO DOC AFTER A NEW RENDER, 
AS A NEW QUARTO RENDER WOULD GENERATE A NEW DOC FOLDER. SO IT WOULD DELETE THE HTML FILE.

new update: now just put the google thing outside the doc folder and render, then move it in when on github

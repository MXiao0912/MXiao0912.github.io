Hi there! I'm Mingmei and I'm currently a PhD student from University of Cambridge specializing in Financial Econometrics and Empirical Asset Pricing. I obtained my M.Phil. degree in Economic Research from the University of Cambridge and hold a Bachelor's degree in Economics from the University of Birmingham and Southwestern University of Finance and Economics. My research interests include Exchange Traded Funds market microstructure, forecast reconciliation, and dynamic panel data methods. Outside of work, I enjoy cooking and playing the guitar.
